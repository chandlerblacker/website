        "Hello"
My name is Chandler Blacker.   I enjoy playing sports, especially basketball.  I also enjoy baking, hiking, riddles, and especially coding.  I live in Texas, near Dallas.  I have been homeschooled most of my life, and am now taking online college classes.  

"School"
Right now, the time of making this, I am attending BYU-I taking a course on web design.  Based off credits, I am a Junior in college, however I am only 17.  I was homeschooled since second grade and this allowed me to start dual credit very early and get a head start.  I plan on finishing my bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering, then going on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as soon as I turn 18.  After that, I will return to school to get a second degree.

      <h3>My life</h3>
      <p>
        "Homeschool"
I have been homeschooled since second grade.  It may seem like I didn’t get much social interaction, but really, I had an amazing homeschool group that I spent a lot of time with.  I still am great friends with most of these people.  Despite this, I was always a little shy.  I frequently would have the right answer or a good idea and simply wouldn’t share.  Homeschool was really beneficial for me though.  My first-grade teacher told my parents that before the school year, I knew almost everything that they were going to teach, and that afterwards I had improved almost none.  This is one of the main reasons I started homeschooling.  I was able to learn much faster.  Being homeschooled also allowed me to take dual credit starting at age 13.  I did most of my classes online, but when I was 14 I went in-person to the community college.   I looked really out of place in class, most people were 5-15 years older than me, but I didn’t really mind.  I actually had multiple people ask me for help understanding concepts.
"Scouts"
I did Boy Scouts from ages 8-14.  Usually, it takes until almost 18 to get an Eagle Scout, however I worked extra hard and got it at 14.  Scouts took countless hours of hard work, serving the community and learning life skills.  One of the most important lessons I learned from scouting was how to talk in front of people.  I had to do this for multiple classes and merit badges.  I had a friend in scouts who was super talkative, but also clumsy.  By being with him, I learned that you can make a lot of embarrassing mistakes, and people will still like you.  I had always feared people not liking me for saying something wrong or not knowing something that “everybody knows” because I was homeschooled.  Though this friend and experiences in scouting, I learned to be myself and not worry, which would help me a lot in jobs I had later.

      <h3>My Jobs</h3>
      <p>
        "Lifeguarding"
Lifeguarding was the first job I ever had.  I started when I was 15.  I learned a few things from this job, mainly patience and finding joy in my circumstances.  Lifeguarding was very hard for me, sitting in the sun eight hours a day for $8.50 an hour was not my idea of a good day.  However, I learned to be patient and content.  I would have quit, but I felt really bad for the lifeguard company.  This was right after covid and the company was really struggling to find enough people.  They let me do things they usually have 18-year-olds do, because they were so short-staffed.
"In N Out"
In N Out was where I went after lifeguarding.  This was a drastic change for me.  In N Out was so much better than lifeguarding.  I worked for almost twice the money and it was way more fun.  I made a lot of friends really quickly and grew to love working there.  I looked forward to each shift.  I worked really hard to do well for the customers and company.  The management saw me working hard and quickly promoted me, and kept promoting me until I was cooking and started making $20 an hour.  Usually at In N Out, it takes 2-3 years to become a cook, but I did it in about 9 months.  I learned a lot from In N Out.  I learned about working for a good company.  In N Out gave me a chance to get a raise if I worked hard enough.  They also threw parties for their associates and gave us plenty of benefits.  In N Out cared about me as an individual, instead of just an employee, and I really liked that. 
"Coding"
I learned I liked coding pretty quickly.  I took a class where we did a little coding to help with a problem, and I loved it.  I started doing classes about it and soon realized I was pretty good at it.  There were many assignments where I was told they would take around three hours, but I did them in 30 minutes and got full marks.  Soon, I decided to get a little job in coding to see if it was something I would truly like.  I worked for my cousin with his business.  He had an app to help small businesses with online marketing.  I was doing pretty simple things most of the time, things like changing variable names, but by the end I was writing code to improve the app.  I learned a lot during this.  I learned a lot about databases and Github, along with other programs that developers use.
